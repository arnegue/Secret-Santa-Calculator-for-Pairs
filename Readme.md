# Secret Santa Calculator

This is a simple calculator for Secret Santa ("Wichteln") for pairs.

## What does that mean
Usually secret santa doesn't care about the relation of the people. This one at least looks that the gifter and 
giftee/gifted (what are the right terms here?) are not a couple/pair.

## How do I use this program
1. Put the real pairs and names into `pair_list.json`
2. Start main.py: `python main.py`

That's it :)

## Disclaimer
I bet this is one of many many many others. 
1. I was too lazy to search for one which fits
2. Small challenge for me to code this (I bet there is room for optimization) 
3. This one doesn't steal any data
4. OPEN SOURCE, yay! (Do what you want, I don't mind. I think it's kinda hard to hurt someone with this piece of code)
